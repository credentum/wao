Run a HyperBEAM node on your smartphone.

## Supported Versions

We currently target two pre-release versions:

- `v0.9-milestone-3-beta-1` (default)
- `v0.9-milestone-3-beta-3`

These guides will be updated when the final version is released.

## How It Works

HyperBEAM is built on Erlang/OTP and includes native components (WASM runtime, LMDB database). Running it on mobile requires:

1. **Linux environment** - HyperBEAM needs Linux syscalls
2. **ARM64 compilation** - Mobile processors use ARM64, not x86_64
3. **Native library recompilation** - NIFs must link against the device's libc

On **Android**, we use [Termux](https://termux.dev) which provides a native Linux environment with direct hardware access. HyperBEAM runs at near-native speed.

On **iOS**, Apple doesn't allow direct Linux execution. We use [UTM SE](https://getutm.app) to emulate an entire ARM64 Linux VM, which is significantly slower.

## Platforms

| Platform | Method | Performance | Recommended |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [Android](/mobile/android) | Termux (native) | ⚡ Fast | ✅ Yes |
| [iOS](/mobile/ios) | UTM SE (emulated) | 🐢 Slow | ❌ No |

## Android

Android runs HyperBEAM natively through Termux. The build process compiles in Alpine Linux (via proot) then deploys to Termux with recompiled native libraries.

## iOS

iOS requires a full Linux VM running in UTM SE. We build on Android first, then transfer the compiled binary to iOS. Performance is limited by software emulation.
