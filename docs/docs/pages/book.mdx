# The HyperBEAM Book (Pre-Release)

![](/images/book.jpg)

**From Zero to Building Custom Devices**

This book teaches you to build custom HyperBEAM devices. You'll start by learning Erlang, then progressively work through the codebase from low-level primitives to high-level devices. By the end, you'll understand every module and be ready to create your own.
